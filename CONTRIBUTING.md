## 🚀 Reporting Bugs or Proposing Improvements

If you identify:

- A functional bug  
- A UI/UX inconsistency  
- A documentation error  
- A minor or major enhancement  
- A refactor that improves code quality or maintainability  

You must **create a new issue and wait for it to be approved**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project uses:
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui
- **Package Manager**: pnpm ⚠️ *(do NOT use npm or yarn)*

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) - install it via:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

> ⚠️ **This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager.** Do not use `npm install` or `yarn` - it will create the wrong lockfile and your PR will be rejected.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [CareXpert Frontend repository](https://github.com/gdg-charusat/CareXpert_frontend)
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CareXpert_frontend.git
cd CareXpert_frontend
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork synced:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gdg-charusat/CareXpert_frontend.git
```

Verify the remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:
- `origin` - your fork (`https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CareXpert_frontend.git`)
- `upstream` - the original repository (`https://github.com/gdg-charusat/CareXpert_frontend.git`)

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 5: Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 6: Create a New Branch

**IMPORTANT**: Always create a new branch for your work. Never work directly on the `main` branch.

```bash
# First, sync your fork with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - for new features (e.g., `feature/add-appointment-page`)
- `fix/` - for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/navbar-responsive`)
- `docs/` - for documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `style/` - for styling changes (e.g., `style/improve-button-design`)
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-components`)

---

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 1. Pick an Issue

- Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/gdg-charusat/CareXpert_frontend/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled:
  - `good-first-issue` or `beginner` - for beginners (Level 1)
  - `intermediate` - for intermediate level (Level 2)
- **Comment on the issue** with your request and team number, e.g.:
  > *"Hi, I'd like to work on this issue. - Team 07"*
- **Wait to be officially assigned** - do not start writing any code until a maintainer assigns you
- **Do not work on an issue already assigned to someone else**

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Test your changes thoroughly in the browser
- Ensure the application runs without errors or warnings

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the development server
pnpm dev

pnpm build

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages following the conventional commits format:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add appointment booking page"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` - new feature (e.g., `feat: add doctor profile card`)
- `fix:` - bug fix (e.g., `fix: resolve navbar mobile responsiveness`)
- `docs:` - documentation changes (e.g., `docs: update installation guide`)
- `style:` - formatting, CSS changes (e.g., `style: improve button hover effects`)

## 🎯 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with beginner issues to understand the codebase
2. **Read Existing Code**: Look at how similar features are implemented
3. **Always use pnpm**: Never switch to npm or yarn mid-project
4. **Ask Questions**: It's better to ask than to waste time going in the wrong direction
5. **Be Patient**: Code review takes time, be responsive to feedback
6. **Have Fun**: Open source is about learning and community!
